The user and service management system is a simple CRUD (Create, Ready, Update, Delete) system.

Some maain features are:

As a Safe Life admin:

- I can create/edit a new type of Case Worker Role
- I can attach a Case worker role to a specific dataset

- I can create/edit a new user based on the four main types.
- I can attach a a user to a service

- I can create/edit a service

As a user:

- I can login to the application to access the main feature (see other part of the documenation)
